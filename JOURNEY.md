# Display Configuration Journey

## The Evolution from Basic to Material Design

This document chronicles the development process from a basic working display to a polished Material Design interface.

---

## Stage 1: Basic Display Working ‚úÖ

**Achievement**: Got the ST7701S display to show pixels

**Key Issues Solved**:
- Found correct vendor-specific init sequence
- Implemented VCOM stabilization delay (10s)
- Disabled WiFi on boot
- Configured PSRAM properly

**Result**: Black screen ‚Üí Working display with basic LVGL

---

## Stage 2: Adding Icons üé®

**Goal**: Make the interface more visually appealing

**Challenges**:
- Initial attempt caused Guru Meditation errors (memory issues)
- Icons were too large/complex
- Multiple icon font sizes crashed device

**Solutions**:
- Simplified font configuration
- Reduced buffer size to 25%
- Used single icon font size (48px)
- Removed shadow effects to save memory
- Added `bpp: 2` for better rendering

**Result**: Stable interface with Material Design Icons

---

## Stage 3: Layout & Spacing üìê

**Problems Encountered**:
- Icons overlapping text
- "Sitting Room" text squashed on temperature
- Wrong icon showing beside time (was showing moon instead of thermometer)
- Text difficult to read on colored buttons

**Fixes Applied**:
- Corrected unicode for thermometer: `\U000F050F`
- Adjusted y-positions for better spacing
- Changed font sizes (small: 18px, medium: 26px, large: 56px)
- Moved "Sitting Room" label higher (y: 10 instead of y: 20)
- Improved card padding and alignment

---

## Stage 4: Color Correction üåà

**The Big Discovery**: Display uses BGR color order, not RGB!

**Symptoms**:
- Header showing as cyan/green instead of red
- Icons showing wrong colors
- Button not obviously yellow when ON

**The Fix**: Convert ALL colors from RGB to BGR

### Color Conversion Table

| Element | Intended Color | RGB Code | BGR Code | Notes |
|---------|---------------|----------|----------|-------|
| Header | Red | `0xD32F2F` | `0x2F2FD3` | Material Design Red 700 |
| Moon Icon | Light Blue | `0x90CAF9` | `0xF9CA90` | Night time indicator |
| Thermometer | Orange | `0xFF8A65` | `0x658AFF` | Temperature icon |
| Button ON | Yellow | `0xFFEB3B` | `0x3BEBFF` | High visibility |
| Button OFF | Gray | `0x424242` | `0x424242` | Symmetric, no change |
| Cards | Dark Gray | `0x2C2C2C` | `0x2C2C2C` | Symmetric, no change |
| Background | Black | `0x121212` | `0x121212` | Symmetric, no change |
| Text | White | `0xFFFFFF` | `0xFFFFFF` | Symmetric, no change |

**Result**: Correct colors displaying properly!

## Stage 5: Dynamic UI Elements üîÑ

**Feature**: Button changes color based on light state

**Implementation**:
```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: office_light_state
    on_state:
      then:
        - if ON: Yellow button + dark text
        - if OFF: Gray button + white text
```

**Benefits**:
- Immediate visual feedback
- Clear ON/OFF states
- Better UX with color psychology (yellow = active/on)

---

## Stage 6: Text Contrast Improvements üìù

**Problem**: White text hard to read on yellow button when ON

**Solution**: Dynamic text colors
- ON state: Dark gray text (`0x1A1A1A`) on yellow
- OFF state: White text (`0xFFFFFF`) on gray

**Applied to**:
- Button label ("Office Light")
- Status text ("ON" / "OFF")
- Lightbulb icon

---

## Stage 7: Final Polish ‚ú®

**Changes Made**:
1. Header title updated from "Smart Home" to user preference
2. Consistent card sizing (160px for time/temp, 140px for button)
3. Proper icon spacing (x: 10 for icons, x: 15 for text)
4. Rounded corners (16px radius) for modern look
5. Material Design color palette throughout

**Final Features**:
- ‚úÖ Portrait 480√ó640 display
- ‚úÖ Material Design dark theme
- ‚úÖ Proper BGR color handling
- ‚úÖ Material Design Icons (home, moon, thermometer, lightbulb)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic button colors (yellow when ON, gray when OFF)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic text contrast for readability
- ‚úÖ Home Assistant integration (time, temperature, light control)
- ‚úÖ Touch support with proper calibration
- ‚úÖ Stable memory usage (25% buffer)
- ‚úÖ No crashes or Guru Meditation errors

## Lessons Learned üìö

### 1. Memory Management is Critical
- ESP32-S3 with LVGL needs careful memory management
- Simpler UI = more stable
- Shadow effects and complex nesting can cause crashes
- 25% buffer size is the sweet spot

### 2. BGR vs RGB Matters!
- Display uses BGR color order
- ALL colors must be converted: `0xRRGGBB` ‚Üí `0xBBGGRR`
- Symmetric colors (grays, white, black) don't need conversion
- Test colors visually - what you see is what you get!

### 3. Icon Font Configuration
- One size font file is more stable than multiple
- Include ONLY the glyphs you use
- Use `bpp: 2` for antialiasing
- Verify unicode codes from official MDI documentation

### 4. Layout Best Practices
- Use TOP_MID/BOTTOM_MID/CENTER alignment
- Adjust with x/y offsets
- Don't overlap elements - leave breathing room
- Test on actual hardware (simulator isn't accurate)

### 5. VCOM Delay is Non-Negotiable
- Always wait 10 seconds before WiFi
- Don't skip this even if "it seems to work"
- Prevents random crashes and display issues
- Better safe than debugging weird problems later

### 6. Touch Calibration
- Portrait mode: no transform needed
- Landscape mode: swap_xy: true, mirror_y: true
- Test all corners and edges
- Calibration depends on rotation setting

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Mistake 1: Skipping VCOM Delay
**Symptom**: Random crashes, display flashing, reboots
**Fix**: Add 10s delay in `on_boot` before WiFi

### Mistake 2: Using RGB Colors
**Symptom**: Wrong colors (red shows cyan, etc.)
**Fix**: Convert to BGR format for all colors

### Mistake 3: Too Many Icon Sizes
**Symptom**: Guru Meditation errors, crashes
**Fix**: Use one icon font size (48px works well)

### Mistake 4: Wrong Icon Unicode
**Symptom**: Wrong icon or empty box displayed
**Fix**: Check https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/ for correct code

### Mistake 5: Text Overlapping
**Symptom**: Squashed text, unreadable labels
**Fix**: Use proper y-offsets and alignment (TOP_MID/BOTTOM_MID)

### Mistake 6: WiFi Enabled on Boot
**Symptom**: Power issues during init, unstable display
**Fix**: Set `enable_on_boot: false`

### Mistake 7: Wrong MADCTL Value
**Symptom**: Rotated/flipped display
**Fix**: Match rotation setting with MADCTL byte
